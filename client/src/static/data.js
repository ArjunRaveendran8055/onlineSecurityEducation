We don’t live in an ideal world and most interviewers like me, skim through your resume 5-10 minutes before an interview. A nice resume should explain your expertise, skills and achievements in under 1-2 minutes of reading it. Please don’t make a resume with more than 3 pages. It makes it difficult for the interviewer to go through everything, chances are that he will skip a lot things that you want to highlight. Your resume should have the following sections.Before going into each sections, here are few things that you should consider. The most important part of a resume, atleast for me are Summary, Work Experience and Others. Make sure that these sections are appropriately highlighted to the interviewer. Except for the summary, it is better to use points that explains the meat of the idea than writing long paragraphs. The trick is to keep it short, highlighted and clear. Avoid using abbreviations that are not generic. Now let’s talk about each section.  "

                                    It’s always nice to add information about the extra aptitude, science or art exams that you have passed and also add the details of courses that you have learned online from edX, Coursera, Udemy etc. This gives an impression to the interviewer that you have an aspiration towards learning new things.`

We don’t live in an ideal world and most interviewers like me, skim through your resume 5-10 minutes before an interview. A nice resume should explain your expertise, skills and achievements in under 1-2 minutes of reading it. Please don’t make a resume with more than 3 pages. It makes it difficult for the interviewer to go through everything, chances are that he will skip a lot things that you want to highlight. Your resume should have the following sections.Before going into each sections, here are few things that you should consider. The most important part of a resume, atleast for me are Summary, Work Experience and Others. Make sure that these sections are appropriately highlighted to the interviewer. Except for the summary, it is better to use points that explains the meat of the idea than writing long paragraphs. The trick is to keep it short, highlighted and clear. Avoid using abbreviations that are not generic. Now let’s talk about each section.  "

Instead of mentioning company names you can describe about your hobby security projects that you have worked with, scripts or tools that you have developed, open source contributions, your security blog, bug bounties, the extra curricular courses that you have did, the things that you have learned and tried out after reading a blog or paper etc. Be creative, include everything related to security that you think will add an impression about you to the interviewer.`

                                    It’s always nice to add information about the extra aptitude, science or art exams that you have passed and also add the details of courses that you have learned online from edX, Coursera, Udemy etc. This gives an impression to the interviewer that you have an aspiration towards learning new things.`

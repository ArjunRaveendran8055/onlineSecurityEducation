We don’t live in an ideal world and most interviewers like me, skim through your resume 5-10 minutes before an interview. A nice resume should explain your expertise, skills and achievements in under 1-2 minutes of reading it. Please don’t make a resume with more than 3 pages. It makes it difficult for the interviewer to go through everything, chances are that he will skip a lot things that you want to highlight. Your resume should have the following sections.Before going into each sections, here are few things that you should consider. The most important part of a resume, atleast for me are Summary, Work Experience and Others. Make sure that these sections are appropriately highlighted to the interviewer. Except for the summary, it is better to use points that explains the meat of the idea than writing long paragraphs. The trick is to keep it short, highlighted and clear. Avoid using abbreviations that are not generic. Now let’s talk about each section.  "

We don’t live in an ideal world and most interviewers like me, skim through your resume 5-10 minutes before an interview. A nice resume should explain your expertise, skills and achievements in under 1-2 minutes of reading it. Please don’t make a resume with more than 3 pages. It makes it difficult for the interviewer to go through everything, chances are that he will skip a lot things that you want to highlight. Your resume should have the following sections.Before going into each sections, here are few things that you should consider. The most important part of a resume, atleast for me are Summary, Work Experience and Others. Make sure that these sections are appropriately highlighted to the interviewer. Except for the summary, it is better to use points that explains the meat of the idea than writing long paragraphs. The trick is to keep it short, highlighted and clear. Avoid using abbreviations that are not generic. Now let’s talk about each section.  "
